# PokemonRandomizerTracker

To run the tracker, run "python -m src" from the base directory. If you're missing modules, then you should install them :)

## Major TODOs:
*  Refactor - Global Database / Controller accessible to all elements
*  Refactor - Common base class for Elements (update + layout)
*  Display Tab - Pokemon Abilities
*  Display Tab - Clicking on Location takes you to appropriate place in Location tab
*  Moves Tab - Add TM notation
*  (new) Items Tab
*  Team Tab - Stat Analysis

## Minor TODOs:
*  Refactor - Rename many files
*  Refactor - Rename directory so you don't have to do "python -m src"
*  Display Tab - Add trades to occurrences
*  Display Tab - Add starters to occurrences
*  Moves Tab - Filter by TM or not
*  Moves Tab - Filter by Type
*  Moves Tab - Filter by Category
*  Moves Tab - Sort by Power
*  Moves Tab - Move Tutors
*  Settings file (default ingested file, theme)

## Future Ideas:
*  Trainers Tab?
*  Starters Tab?
*  More Graphs?
*  Home Tab should look nicer/have more features... but what features?
